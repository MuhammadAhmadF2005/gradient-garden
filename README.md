# 🌿 Gradient Garden

> A collection of machine learning experiments and models — where ideas grow, bloom, and sometimes overfit 🌸

## 📘 About the Project

**Gradient Garden** is my personal machine learning playground.
Here I explore and implement various ML concepts — from data preprocessing and visualization to regression models and fine-tuned ensembles.

The goal: to understand how each algorithm “learns” and to nurture intuition about how data, models, and evaluation metrics connect.

## 🧠 Current Project: California Housing Prediction

A regression task predicting median house values in California using census data.

### ✨ Highlights

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and pipeline creation.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized relationships between income, location, and housing prices using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* **Models Implemented:**

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor (with Grid Search fine-tuning)
* **Performance Metric:** RMSE ≈ **47,000** after model tuning
